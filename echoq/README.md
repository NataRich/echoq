## Backend of Echoq
#### author: Harold澂冰 (Mr. Ye)

### Database
The database is MySQL for this project. There are two tables: a user table and a question table.

### Components and how the Backend is being Constructed
The language is Java, by the edition of 11. The framework is Spring Boot and Mybatis-Plus. These two really helps when developing web application backends.

### How is my password is being protected
The Backend integrates with AES256 Encryption and the authentication key is different in the deployment than displayed in the open source file here. It is impossible to crack the safe house of AES 256 unless NP=P~=NP-Complete (a computer scientists' joke).
